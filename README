All code was written in Java, so the prerequisite for running the program is that the Java environment needs to be installed on the machine.

There are two ways to run the program:

First way: run "Project.jar" from the command prompt window
1. Open a command prompt window and find the directory for "Project.jar".
2. Run the JAR file by using the Java-JAR command: "java -jar Project.jar".
3. Input the total number of stacks and click the button "Reshuffling".
4. The results will be displayed in the box below
5. The detailed run log will be displayed on the command prompt window.

Second way: run the program in Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA
1. Open Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA and import the "Project".
2. Execute the "Client" in the "presentation package" under "src".
3. Input the total number of stacks and click the button "Reshuffling".
4. The results will be displayed in the box below
